omap44xx USB pre-bootloader loader.

See README.md for usage.

TODO:
* [ ] Parse the ASIC ID and pretty-print it.
* [ ] Loading is still flakey: rare occasions give I/O errors for no reason.
  * [ ] Is there any way to contain the OMAP protocol in a class separate from the verrry useful interactive prints?
* [ ] Factoring (of course)
* [ ] Look up the USB MTU and set it as a default value on ugen.read(len=)
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Documentation:
  * [ ] how signing works
  * [ ] photos to go with my instructions
  * [ ] Collect a list of "good" boot images and/or instructions on how to build them

        ugen(4) bulk endpoints behave essentially like SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets.
        However, by default, read()s *must* know the *exact* size of the packet
        they are expecting, or else the kernel gives an I/O error.
        This is because USB is a packet based protocol and ugen does no buffering.
        
        socket has recvmsg() for this case, but unless ugen(4) gained a terrible
        ioctl() API for packets, it has to fudge packet semantics into the
        read()/write() streaming semantics. Personally, I think the BSD devs did
        a very good job in squeezing the two together.
        
        But! There's almost a way out: USB_SET_SHORT_XFER allows overly-long
        reads to succeed. So long as your read packets are not unbounded (and
        technically they can't be because USB has upper limits), you can just
        tell read() large numbers that you don't actually expect to see. This is
        just like how with tcpdump you can't set the capture length to infinity
        but 65536--the maximum transfer unit of ip--is just as good.
        
        If you actually need finer control than this you need to not use ugen(4).
        Use libusb instead.
